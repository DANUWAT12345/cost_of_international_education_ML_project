## Overview

We analyzed the cost of studying in different countries using K-Means clustering. The data includes tuition, living cost, rent, visa, and insurance.

## Steps

1. Got the dataset from Kaggle  
2. Cleaned and standardized the data  
3. Used the Elbow Method to find the best number of clusters  
4. Applied K-Means to group similar countries  
5. Visualized results with charts and maps  
6. Built a function to predict cluster from new data

## Tools Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- GeoPandas

## Use Case

- Students can compare study costs  
- Schools can benchmark their fees  
- Governments can use it for policy planning
