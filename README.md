# Project Title: Cost of International Education Analysis using K-Means Clustering

**Project Description: This project aims to analyze the cost of international education across different countries using machine learning techniques. Specifically, it leverages the K-Means clustering algorithm to group countries based on various cost factors such as tuition fees, living costs, rent, visa fees, and insurance.**

Key Steps:

Data Acquisition: The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle ("adilshamim8/cost-of-international-education") containing information about education costs in various countries.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The data undergoes a cleaning process to handle missing values and remove irrelevant entries. Numerical features are then standardized using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scaling.
Clustering with K-Means: The K-Means algorithm is applied to the preprocessed data to identify clusters of countries with similar education costs. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow method.
Visualization and Analysis: Cluster results are visualized using scatter plots and maps to gain insights into the characteristics of each cluster. Further analysis is conducted to understand the average cost factors within each cluster.
Prediction: A prediction model is built using the trained K-Means model to predict the cluster for new data points. This allows for estimating the cost category of a country based on its education-related expenses.
Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn (KMeans, StandardScaler)
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Geopandas
Potential Applications:

This analysis can provide valuable information for students planning to study abroad, helping them understand the potential costs associated with different countries.
Educational institutions can use these insights to benchmark their tuition fees and living costs against similar institutions in other countries.
Policymakers can utilize this information to make informed decisions regarding education funding and international student policies.
Contributions:

Feel free to contribute to this project by suggesting improvements to the data analysis, visualization, or prediction model.
You can also contribute by adding new features to the dataset or exploring different clustering techniques.
